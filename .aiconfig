# Flourish Bar Chart Race Project

This project implements a bar chart race visualization using Flourish.

## Key Files:
- src/components/FlourishComponent.tsx: Main component for Flourish visualization
- src/App.tsx: Main application component
- src/types.ts: Type definitions for the project

## Project Structure:
- src/: Source code
- public/: Public assets
- node_modules/: Dependencies (not tracked in git)

## Coding Standards:
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React functional component patterns
- Use hooks for state management

## Common Tasks:
- To add new data: Update the data source in App.tsx
- To modify chart appearance: Adjust options in FlourishComponent.tsx

## Instructions for AI:
- When suggesting code changes, please use TypeScript syntax
- Provide explanations for any complex logic or Flourish-specific implementations
- If referencing Flourish API, please include links to relevant documentation

## Flourish API Key:
- The Flourish API key should be passed as a prop to the FlourishComponent
- Never hard-code the API key in the source files

## Data Format:
- Data should be in the format expected by Flourish bar chart race visualizations
- Typically an array of arrays, with the first array being headers
